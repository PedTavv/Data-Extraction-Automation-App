# Medical Data Automation Tool

## Personal Initiative

This project was undertaken as a personal initiative, driven by my curiosity and passion for exploring the intersection of technology and healthcare. It has been in development for the past year, with a focus on automating data extraction and entry for medical records, improving efficiency and accuracy. Please note that this tool is not intended for public use.

## Key Features
- Automates data extraction and entry
- Implements data validation and duplicate checking
- Provides a user interface for easy data visualization and management
- Utilizes hotkeys for quick actions

## Technical Highlights
- Developed using Lua programming language
- Leverages Hammerspoon for macOS automation, with interaction through JavaScript
- Implements complex data structures and algorithms
- Includes error handling and data integrity checks
- Core code is customizable for various research studies and needs

## Core Components

The `init.lua` script serves as the central configuration file for the tool. It sets up the environment, initializes variables, and manages the activation of different automation scripts (`barrets`, `polyps`, and `polypjson`). Key functionalities include:

- Activating and deactivating scripts through the menu bar
- Emergency stop functionality to terminate all running scripts
- Error logging to track issues during script execution
- Binding hotkeys for quick access to different scripts


## Impact
- Increases efficiency and accuracy in medical record processing for research purposes
- Reduces the risk of data entry errors
